    <br>
    <ul>
   <li><strong>BX-Users</strong>    <br>
    Contains the users. Note that user IDs (`User-ID`) have been anonymized and map to integers. Demographic data is provided (`Location`, `Age`) if available. Otherwise, these fields contain NULL-values.
    </li> 
    <br>
    <li>
        <strong>BX-Books</strong>     <br>
        Books are identified by their respective ISBN. Invalid ISBNs have already been removed from the dataset. Moreover, some content-based information is given (`Book-Title`, `Book-Author`, `Year-Of-Publication`, `Publisher`), obtained from Amazon Web Services. Note that in case of several authors, only the first is provided. URLs linking to cover images are also given, appearing in three different flavours (`Image-URL-S`, `Image-URL-M`, `Image-URL-L`), i.e., small, medium, large. These URLs point to the Amazon web site.
    
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        
       <strong>BX-Book-Ratings</strong>     <br>
        Contains the book rating information. Ratings (`Book-Rating`) are either explicit, expressed on a scale from 1-10 (higher values denoting higher appreciation), or implicit, expressed by 0.
